### **1. Introduction to the Shell**

- **Definition:** The shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. It acts as an interface between the **User** and the **Kernel**.
    
- **Terminal vs. Shell:** The _terminal_ is the window that accepts input; the _shell_ is the program running inside that window processing the commands.
    
- **Prompt:** typically looks like `[username@hostname directory]$`.
    
    - `~` (Tilde) represents the current user's **Home Directory** (e.g., `/home/bob`).
        
    - `$` indicates a regular user.
        
    - `#` indicates the root user (administrator).

### **2. Basic Navigation**

- **`pwd`** (Print Working Directory): Shows exactly where you are in the filesystem.
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    $ pwd
    /home/bob
    ```
    
- **`ls`** (List): Lists files and directories in the current location.
    
    - `ls -l`: Long listing (shows permissions, owner, size, date).
        
    - `ls -a`: Show all files, including hidden files (those starting with `.`).
        
    - `ls -lt`: Sort by time (newest first).
        
    - `ls -ltr`: Sort by time reverse (oldest first).
        
- **`cd`** (Change Directory): Moves you to a different folder.
    
    - `cd Downloads`: Move into the "Downloads" folder.
        
    - `cd ..`: Move **up** one level (to the parent directory).
        
    - `cd /`: Go to the root of the filesystem.
        
    - `cd ~` (or just `cd`): Return to your home directory.
        
    - `cd -`: Switch back to the _previous_ directory you were in.
        

> **Note on Paths:**
> 
> - **Absolute Path:** Starts from the root `/` (e.g., `/home/bob/Downloads`).
>     
> - **Relative Path:** Starts from where you are currently (e.g., `Downloads/Images`).
>

### **3. Managing Files & Directories**

- **`mkdir`** (Make Directory): Creates a new folder.
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    mkdir Projects
    mkdir -p Asia/India/Mumbai  # Creates nested parent directories automatically
    ```
    
- **`cp`** (Copy): Copies files or directories.
    
    - `cp file1.txt file2.txt`: Duplicates file1 as file2.
        
    - `cp -r folder1 folder2`: Recursively copies a directory and its contents.
        
- **`mv`** (Move/Rename): Moves files or renames them.
    
    - `mv file.txt /home/bob/Documents/`: Moves file to Documents.
        
    - `mv oldname.txt newname.txt`: Renames the file.
        
- **`rm`** (Remove): Deletes files. **Be careful, there is no Recycle Bin.**
    
    - `rm file.txt`: Delete a file.
        
    - `rm -r foldername`: Delete a folder and everything inside it.
        
- **`touch`**: Creates an empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    touch newfile.txt
    ```

### **4. Viewing File Content**

- **`cat`** (Concatenate): Displays the entire content of a file at once.
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    cat filename.txt
    ```
    
- **`more` / `less`**: Pagers that allow you to scroll through large files.
    
    - `less filename.txt` is preferred. Use `q` to quit, arrows to scroll.
        
- **`head`**: Shows the first 10 lines of a file.
    
    - `head -n 5 file.txt` (Shows first 5 lines).
        
- **`tail`**: Shows the last 10 lines of a file.
    
    - `tail -f logfile.log` (Follows the file live as it updates—useful for logs).

### **5. Command Help & Types**

- **Internal vs. External Commands:**
    
    - **Internal:** Built into the shell (e.g., `cd`, `echo`).
        
    - **External:** Separate binary files stored in `/bin` or `/usr/bin` (e.g., `ls`, `mkdir`).
        
    - Check type with: `type [command]` (e.g., `type cd`).
        
- **Getting Help:**
    
    - `man [command]`: Opens the manual page (detailed documentation).
        
    - `[command] --help`: Prints a quick summary of options.
        
    - `whatis [command]`: One-line description of what a command does.

### **6. Bash Shell Features**

- **Tab Completion:** Type the first few letters of a command or filename and press `Tab` to auto-complete it.
    
- **History:**
    
    - `history`: Lists previously executed commands.
        
    - `!123`: Re-runs command number 123 from the history list.
        
- **Variables:**
    
    - `echo $SHELL`: Displays the current shell (usually `/bin/bash`).
        
    - `echo $PS1`: Displays your current prompt settings.
        
- **Aliases:** Create shortcuts for long commands.
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    alias ll='ls -lh'  # Now typing 'll' runs 'ls -lh'
    ```

### **Interactive Lab Scenario (Example)**

_In the KodeKloud labs, you often play the role of "Bob" fixing a directory structure._

1. **Check where you are:** `pwd` (/home/bob)
    
2. **Create a directory tree:** `mkdir -p continents/Asia/India`
    
3. **Navigate there:** `cd continents/Asia/India`
    
4. **Create a file:** `touch capital.txt`
    
5. **Go back home:** `cd ~`
